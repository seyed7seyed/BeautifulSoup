      "Short: Go for it if you can afford.TL;DR;I've been having Apple ecosystem (MBP, Watch, AirPod, iPad and iPhone) for many years.  However, this is my first release day purchase of an Apple device.  Improved camera module in iPhone 11 pro helped me to arrive at this decision and I believe that this is the single most important feature in iPhone 11 pro.  Mainly -- Introduction of new wide angle lens.- Better color reproduction- Night mode (Some online reviews suggested that this can not be changed and is set by Camera app automatically.  This is not true.  You can disable if needed from the selection controls)- 16:9 format (you can set this to default from Settings->Camera->Preserve Settings->Camera Mode).  This is the default in my case- Portrait mode with light settings.  I found that we can take studio quality pictures using this)Here are some images I took at various settings.  You can see the richness of color in each of these photographs.  The first one was in the morning against rising sun.  Look at the accurate exposure on the lawn even with the presence of direct sunlight.  The last one is part of Blue city Jodhpur with Mehrangarh fort in the backdrop.  Though the blue is a bit saturated, it gives a dramatic look for the photos.In addition to Camera, the overall experience is very fluid and effortless (I'm leaving out the iOS13 features as the same is available on older models as well).There are a few drawbacks though. The phone is bit bulkier than previous models.  The advantage is the increased battery life.  I've been able to use the phone for upto 30 hours with over 4 hours of screen time (mainly reading and videos) and close to 1 hour of call.  That's a great improvement compared to previous versions.The second drawback is the price.  But that's the price you pay for quality.  One should be able to use this phone for 4 years at least with OS upgrades and Security updates coming in continuously (Something which I don't see on Android).\n",
